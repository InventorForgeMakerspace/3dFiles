This is a minifig made to hold a roll of TP and stick to your bathroom wall. I like printing in PETG because it's super strong and resists most household cleaners. The head has holes in it for 
3mm magnets so you can print seasonal hats (coming soon).
The body is concave to support a full roll, so I would suggest printing at .2 to get the smoothest transitions possible. If you make 
any hats, please post them as a remix so we can keep them together!
