This is the base and mechanism for a 3D printed arcade joystick. This is meant to be added into your design 
and is not a stand alone item.

Be careful with your tolerances, If the keeper and effector aren't snug on the shaft of the bolt, the joystick will not 
spring back to center after you move it. The keeper should be able to move up and down the shaft freely, but have minimal wobble

You'll need an M8 bolt for the joystick shaft, 4 standard uSwitches

and a spring roughly 12.5mm OD, 11mm ID ( I got mine at home depot for 75 cents).
