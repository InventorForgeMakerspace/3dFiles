This is a stackable case for the raspberry pi that allows you to create a blade center type setup or you can mount one of these 
cases in a standard 5.25 PC mount and have a Pi in your PC. I've included an, untested, rack mount end plate that will allow you 
to mount this in 4U of space.
This case prints in two pieces, the receiver and the carrier. The carrier holds the pi, the receiver holds all of the cables. 
The idea is to have the receiver setup with all of your accessories, power and ethernet plugged into it. The carrier can be docked and 
undocked and holds itself in place using the pi's usb and ethernet ports. Power is supplied via a standard molex PC power supply and 
a 5.5mm barrel jack from a CCTV setup. You can print multiples of these and attach them top to bottom to create a blade center of 
sorts. Just use the PC mounting holes and a bit of plastic to join them together. 

parts required:

USB extension cables, at least 6 inches. I use these.
