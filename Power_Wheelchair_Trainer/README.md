This is the power wheel chair joystick from the 3D Printing in Practice presentation at AOTA 2016. 
Use PETG or another bio safe, washable material for best results. Nylon and polycarbonite also work well, 
but PET is the easiest to print by far

Additional parts will run between $5 and $45 depending on if you want to include sound or not.

In addition to the 3d printed parts, you'll need
